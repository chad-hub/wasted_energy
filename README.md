# Created nor Destroyed: An exploratory analysis of energy wasted to flaring natural gas

The goal of this project is to explore public data to assess the scale of energy flared using techniques and methods learned through the DSI.

# Background and Inspiration

Energy is a passion of mine. Whether I am working on improving existing processes of energy extraction or focusing on renewables, I believe this is a vital area of work. My work experience often left me frustrated with many confounding realities - flaring off natural gas was one of them. Watching natural gas get burned off to flare (the only economically viable option in many remotre areas) specifically frustrated me. Now that I am empowered with the tools, I want to take a deep dive into the data availble and quantify the scale of the energy wasted.

# Data Sources

Luckily, there is a treasure trove of public information available to explore this information:
