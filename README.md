# Created nor Destroyed: An exploratory analysis of energy wasted to flaring natural gas

The goal of this project is to explore public data to assess the scale of energy flared using techniques and methods learned through the DSI.

# Background and Inspiration

Energy is a passion of mine. I believe it is vital that we improve existing means of energy generation while also focusing on renewables.  I am often frustrated by the energy industry's common practice of flaring natural gas - the burning of energy that is otherwise too costly to take to market. Now that I am empowered with the tools, I want to take a deep dive into the data available and visualize the scale of the waste. 

# Data Sources

Luckily, there is a healthy trove of public information available to explore this information:

- **Texas Railroad Commission:**
  - [Natural Gas Production Data](https://rrc.texas.gov/oil-gas/research-and-statistics/production-data/historical-production-data/natural-gas-production-and-well-counts-since-1935/)
  - [Oil Production Data](https://rrc.texas.gov/oil-gas/research-and-statistics/production-data/historical-production-data/crude-oil-production-and-well-counts-since-1935/)
  - [TRRC Commissioner Report](https://rrc.texas.gov/media/56420/sitton-texas-flaring-report-q1-2020.pdf)
  
- **U.S. Energy Information:**
  - [Summary Statistics for Natural Gas - Texas](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_sum_lsum_dcu_STX_a.htm)
  - [Well Locations, Plant Locations, Volumes](https://www.eia.gov/beta/states/states/tx/data/dashboard/natural-gas)
 

  # Strategy
  1. Scrape as much information possible for multple publically available sources.
  2. Establish pipeline of clean, usable data.
  3. Generate visual representations that make the scale of the energy waste clear. Examples of questions I hope to answer:
    - Exactly how much energy have we wasted? How does this compare to historical oil / gas production and consumption?
    - What is the scale of waste in terms compared to other potential uses?
    - What are the economics at play in the flaring? 
    - What does the flare volume look like going forward and what ways is this issue being solved?
  4. Leverage hypothesis testing methods to demonstrate ability to apply lessons to real problems.
